## Overviw of the Project

### Project:Student Grade Tracker
### Objective:
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a Python program that canallow educators or students to input and manage grades for different subjects or assignments. The program will calculate average grades, provide letter grades, and offer an overall grade based on the input data. Additional features like GPA calculation and grade categorization will also be included.
### Key Activities
Identify what grades and information need to be entered (e.g., subject name, grade score, etc.).
Define the data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, to store student grades and subject information.
Create functions for input validation, grade calculations, and GPA determination.
Create a function to convert numerical grades into letter grades 
Show the average grade, letter grade, GPA, and a possible performance assessment
### Technoly Used
####Programming Language: Python (main language for implementing the application).
####Data Structures:
Lists: For storing subjects and grades.
Dictionaries: For mapping grades to letter grades and GPA.
Tuples: To store grade ranges or scale points.
Control Structures:
Loops (for grade inputs and calculations).
Conditional statements (for calculating letter grades and GPA based on numerical scores).
Functions: For modular design and code reuse (e.g., functions for calculating averages, letter grades, and GPA).
